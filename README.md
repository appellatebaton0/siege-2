# Siege Week 2 -> Name TBD
The game I'm making for Hackclub's Siege; The theme this week was Magic!

A puzzle platforming game where you're a magician!

Instead of doing framework progress reports like last time, we're doing devlogs!


## Devlogs (Mon. 10-6-25 to Sun. 10-12-25)
- ### Monday -> Planning
    - I spent this entire day planning out what I want to do in a Notion document.
- ### Tuesday -> Setup & Basic Game Mechanics
    - I imported all the scripts for functionality from my last project (I'm slowly building a modular system)
    - Deleted assets, anything specific to that game, and changed the project name so the time tracking will work right.
